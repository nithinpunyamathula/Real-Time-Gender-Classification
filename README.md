# Real-Time-Gender-Classification
Real-Time-Gender-Classification is a machine learning project that predicts the gender of individuals based on facial images. This project leverages image processing techniques and deep learning models to classify images as either male or female with high accuracy.

Key Features
✅ Preprocessing: Includes resizing, normalization, and augmentation of facial images for optimal model performance.
✅ Deep Learning: Uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features and classify gender effectively.
✅ High Accuracy: Achieves reliable results on both training and test datasets.

How It Works
1️⃣ Data Preparation: The facial images are preprocessed to enhance quality and consistency.
2️⃣ Model Training: A CNN model is trained on a labeled dataset of male and female facial images.
3️⃣ Prediction: The trained model predicts the gender of input facial images.

Technologies Used
🐍 Python
🔥 Keras (Deep Learning Framework)
🎥 OpenCV (Image Processing)
📓 Jupyter Notebook
Future Scope
🚀 Extend to multi-class classification, such as age detection or emotion recognition.
🌐 Deploy the model using web frameworks for real-time applications.
📷 Integrate with live video streams for on-the-fly gender detection.
